# smart-time-table-scheduler
In this project we developed a generic algorithm to schedule classes with 0% clashes using given criteria and available resources (teachers, subject, class / students and rooms / labs).  The software is flexible as you can also modify the timetable after it is generated if demanded by teachers or students to do so.
